# iot-device-simulation-protocol-comparison2
Simulate a small-scale IoT system that connects multiple devices to a central collector. The goal is to explore different IoT communication protocols (Modbus/TCP &amp; MQTT), analyze scalability, and visualize system behavior. This repo showcases IoT basics: device simulation, protocol layers, data storage, and visualization of simulated network faults
